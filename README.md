# Social-Network-API

## Description

This is a social network API that uses a NoSQL database to handle large amounts of unstructured data. It allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friends list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
